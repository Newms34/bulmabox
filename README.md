## About
Bulmabox is a bare-bones dialog box helper in the style of Bootstrap's Bootbox, but written for Bulma. It's still in development, so be warned!

----

## Usage
#### Installation
Just download the index.js file and include it in your HTML with a `script` tag for now.
Please note that while I've included Bulma as an NPM dependency, you're free to include it any other way if you prefer (i.e., via a cdn).

#### Available Functions
Right now, Bulmabox has four separate functions that you can call:
 - `bulmabox.alert()`: Regular alerts, just like old `window.alert()`.
 - `bulmabox.confirm()`: Confirm. Requires a callback function.
 - `bulmabox.prompt()`: Prompt. Also requires a callback function.
 - `bulmabox.custom()`: Dialog with customizable body. 
---
## Arguments
The arguments for the functions are as follows:
 * **Title** (string): The title of your dialog box. Required!
 * **Message** (string): The message of your dialog box. Note: the *second* string provided will *always* be treated as the message. If you only provide one string, you'll just have a title and no message.
 * **Callback** (function): What happens after you click a button. See `Errors` below for which functions require callbacks.
 * **Buttons** (HTML): (only for Custom dialog. Optional). A bunch of Bulma-formatted buttons. See the note below about custom dialogs for important information!
 * **Options** (object): (optional) Generally, this controls the color and language (or custom text) of each button. See `Buttons` below.
---
## Errors
 - If you feed the functions less than one string, Bulmabox will throw an error. I can't make an alert if there's nothing to say!
 - If you use a Confirm or Prompt function and fail to provide a callback function, Bulmabox will throw an error. Both of these expect to *do* something with whatever you're confirming/prompting for, so we need a callback for that. Alert and Custom do not require callbacks.
---
## Special Notes:
##### Custom Dialogs:
 Since the custom dialog's buttons are themselves custom (you can do whatever you want with them), you'll need to manually run some functions if you choose to include said buttons:
 - `bulmabox.runCb(callback,data,[keepAlive])`: Basically, your "Okay" function. This itself has a few parameters:
    - **callback** is the name of the function you wanna run. Normally, this'll just be `bulmabox.params.cb`, which is the callback passed to Bulmabox. 
    - **data** is any data you wanna pass to the callback. If you don't need any data, just pass `true`. 
    - **keepAlive** (boolean) will prevent the custom dialog box from closing on running this callback. If *not* truthy, this will run `bulmabox.kill`, thus closing the modal.
 - `bulmabox.kill('bulmabox-diag')` if you just want the button to close the dialog. You can also substitute another DOM id for `'bulmabox-diag'`, but that'll close whatever that is and *not* the bulmabox modal. Note that if you run `bulmabox.runCb` without a `keepAlive` parameter, that will in turn run this, this closing the dialog box.

##### Options:
The "options" object passed to the functions has a few options itself:
* **Button Colors**: Passed as two separate objects, `okay` and `cancel`. Each of these has two separate properties, `fg` and `bg`, which are, as you'd guess, foreground and background. The colors themselves are either:
    * Bulma class names (i.e., `is-success` for background, or `has-text-success` for foreground).
    * Regular old color codes (i.e., `#fcb340` or `rgb(252,179,64)`)
* **Button Language**: `lang:"fr"`.This allows you to pick the language of the buttons, from 40 available languages. Please note that I only speak Latin and English, so I cannot guarantee the translations (which I stole from bootbox. Thanks guys!).
* **Button Text**: If, as part of the `okay` or `cancel` objects, you pass a `txt` parameter, that will be used to replace the `okay` or `cancel` button text as appropriate. Note that if you do this, it will take precedence over custom language settings. So doing `{lang:'fr',cancel:{txt:'Nah Im good!'}}` will create a dialog with a cancel button that says "Nah Im good", *not* "Annuler".
* **Button Font (New!)**: The default Bulma font is easy to read, but what if you don't want easy? What if you want your buttons in Klingon or Quenya? You can do that! Just pass a `font` property to any buttons you wanna re-style (e.g., `{okay:{font:'Comic Sans MS'}}`). Please note that this is fed directly to the CSS `font-family` property, so doing stuff like '24pt italic Comic Sans MS'... probably won't work.

#### Global Options (New-ish!):
You can now set global options for four parameters:
 * The language: `bulmbox.opts({lang:'fr'})`
 * The header and footer background: `bulmabox.opts({hfBg:'red'})`
 * The main background: `bulmabox.opts({mainBg:'blue'})`
 * Centering the text in the header and footer: `bulmabox.opts({centr:true})`

 Finally, you can reset all of this by just running `bulmabox.opts({reset:true})`. Finally, you can override the global `window.alert()` method by running `bulmabox.opts({globalAlert:true})` 

##### **_Examples:_**
Dialog with an okay button of "Sic" and a cancel button of "Non"

    op = {
        lang:'la'
    }

Dialog with an okay button of "Got it!" and a cancel button of "Ä°ptal" (Turkish):

    op = {
        lang:'tr',
        okay:{
            txt:'Got it!'
        }
    }

Dialog with an okay button with blue fg, `is-success` bg, and Latin buttons:
    
    op = {
        lang:'la',
        okay:{
            bg:"is-success",
            fg:"#009"
        }
    }

## Tests
I've included a sample HTML file in the `\test` folder for your convenience. It's also got some nice tables to explain all the nitty-gritty details.
